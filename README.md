# voice-coil

An EtherCAT master application that runs a hardware-synchronized, sub-millisecond
current-control loop on an **Advanced Motion Controls (AMC)** servo drive to command
a voice-coil motor. Built on [SOEM 2](https://github.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/SOEM).

The program brings a CiA 402 drive up into **Cyclic Synchronous Torque (CST)** mode,
commands a sine-wave current for a fixed duration, monitors the fieldbus for faults,
and logs every cycle to CSV for offline analysis.

## What it does

1. Discovers the EtherCAT network on a given NIC and locates the AMC drive.
2. Configures the drive over SDO during PreOp→SafeOp (CST mode, interpolation period,
   PDO mappings) and reads its peak-current rating for current scaling.
3. Walks the CiA 402 state machine to **Operation Enabled**.
4. Enters real-time mode (memory locked, pinned to an isolated core, `SCHED_FIFO`)
   and runs the DC-SYNC0-synchronized cyclic loop:
   - generates a sine-wave target current (`SINE_FREQ_HZ`, `SINE_AMPLITUDE_A`)
   - exchanges process data every `CYCLE_TIME_MS`
   - validates the working counter and the drive state every cycle
   - records per-cycle timing jitter and PDO round-trip time
5. Shuts the drive down cleanly and exports samples + faults to `data/*.csv`.

All blocking I/O is kept out of the cyclic loop; diagnostics and CSV export happen
after it returns. See [docs/rt-implementation.md](docs/rt-implementation.md).

## Requirements

- Linux, ideally a `PREEMPT_RT` kernel (developed on 6.8 RT)
- [SOEM 2](https://github.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/SOEM) installed (headers under
  `soem/` and a linkable `soem` library)
- CMake ≥ 3.28, a C compiler, `libm`
- Root (or `CAP_NET_RAW` + `CAP_IPC_LOCK` + `CAP_SYS_NICE`) to open a raw socket,
  lock memory, and use real-time scheduling
- Python 3 with `matplotlib` for the plotting script (optional)

## Build

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

This produces `build/voice-coil`.

## Run

```bash
sudo ./build/voice-coil <IFNAME>      # e.g. eno1
```

Run with no arguments to list available network interfaces. Output CSVs are written
to `data/`:

- `voice_coil_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` — per-cycle samples (currents, analog inputs,
  `cycle_jitter_us`, `pdo_exchange_us`)
- `voice_coil_faults_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` — fault events with recovery action

## Configuration

Runtime parameters are compile-time constants in [voice_coil.h](voice_coil.h):

| Constant | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CYCLE_TIME_MS` | 0.5 | EtherCAT cycle period |
| `SINE_FREQ_HZ` | 10.0 | Target current waveform frequency |
| `SINE_AMPLITUDE_A` | 2.0 | Target current waveform amplitude |
| `RUN_DURATION_S` | 30.0 | Total run time |
| `RT_CPU_CORE` | 1 | Isolated core for the cyclic loop |

## Real-time setup

For predictable sub-millisecond latency the host needs kernel and NIC tuning
(core isolation, C-state limits, IRQ affinity, NIC offload/coalescing off).
Details and measured results are in:

- [docs/rt-implementation.md](docs/rt-implementation.md) — code + system changes and benchmarks
- [docs/realtime-tuning.md](docs/realtime-tuning.md) — kernel command-line tuning guide
- [scripts/setup-ethercat-nic.sh](scripts/setup-ethercat-nic.sh) — dedicates and tunes the fieldbus NIC

## Plotting

```bash
python scripts/plot_voice_coil_log.py [path/to/log.csv]
```

With no argument it plots the newest log in `data/`: actual/target/demand current
and the two analog inputs against a shared time axis.

## Source layout

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `voice-coil.c` | `main()` — setup, RT mode entry/exit, shutdown |
| `fieldbus.c` | EtherCAT lifecycle: init, discovery, state management |
| `amc_config.c` | AMC drive SDO configuration (PO2SOconfig hook) |
| `cia402.c` | CiA 402 state-machine bring-up |
| `control_loop.c` | Real-time cyclic loop: waveform, PDO exchange, fault + timing monitoring |
| `diagnostics.c` | Fault decoding and post-fault SDO diagnostics |
| `logging.c` | In-memory sample/fault buffers and CSV export |
| `voice_coil.h` | Shared types, PDO layouts, object indices, configuration constants |
